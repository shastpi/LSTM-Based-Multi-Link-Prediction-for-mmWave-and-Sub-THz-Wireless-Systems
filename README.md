# LSTM-Based-Multi-Link-Prediction-for-mmWave-and-Sub-THz-Wireless-Systems
A code snippet from the paper to be presented at ICC 2020 fro multi-link prediction using LSTM. Note that this code was used for overall prediction performed at 28 and 140 GHz. The prediction the code is performing in the jupyter notebook file is on only one channel trajectory and it gives an idea about how to approach the multi-link prediction problem in general. More updates on theory and simulation setup to be added soon.
